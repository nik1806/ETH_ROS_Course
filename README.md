## Exercise 1
The task is to create a launch with Robocup14 world and control the robot using keyboard teleop for twist robots.
The final scene from my implementation looks like this:

## Exercise 2
We implemented laser input to the robot and the visualization in rviz tool. We also incorporate parameters for the robot and subscribers.

## Exercise 3
We perceive the distance and position of nearest object (pillar). A simple P controller is implemented to navigate to the nearest object and 3D points are visualization in rviz tool.
